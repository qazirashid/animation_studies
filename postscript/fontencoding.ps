% Each postscript font dictionary contains the encoding for its characters. 
% Each character in the font is associated with an integer between 0 and 255.
%
% Many characters in a postscript font might not have any associated key on
% the keyboard. Such characters are referred to by their codes.
% Many fonts may not have a standard encoding and need to be assigned an 
% encoding.
%
% To get characters outlines, use  
% (STR) true charpath
% This will add the outlines of all characters in STR to the current path.

%Lets write a procedure that rotates and prints a strings in circlular shape.

/oshow {  % stack: (STR)
    % when the procedure is called, it expects an STR to have been placed 
    % on the stack. 
    true  % prepare to get outlines: stack : (STRT) true
    charpath  % add outlnes to current path.
    % Note charpath will remove 'true' and (STR) from stack.
    % Underneath it will be the currentpath.
    .5 0 0 setrgbcolor
    %.5 setgray
    stroke% stroke the path. This removes the path from stack.
