% The image operator takes five arguments
% scan length : number of samples per scan line.
% scan lines  : number of scan lines in the image
% bits per sample:  [1,2,4,8] number of bits per sample.
% transform matrix: transform matrix to be applied to the image.
% Procedure:  this procedure produces data strings required by the image.
% This can be any postscript procedure that leaves a string on the stack.
% The image operator takes this string and interprets its characters as sample
% data. 
% If one call to the procedure does not produce enough data to complete the 
% whole image, the procedure will be called multiple times until enough data
% is produces the completes the image.
